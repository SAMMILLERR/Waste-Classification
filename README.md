# Waste Classification Project

## Overview

This project is a waste classification system that uses machine learning to categorize different types of waste. The model is trained using Jupyter Notebook and deployed in a Python script, with an Arduino setup for automation.

## Features

- **Machine Learning Model**: Trained to classify different types of waste.
- **Python Integration**: Model is implemented in a Python script.
- **Arduino Control**: Uses servo motors to automate waste disposal.
- **Dataset Handling**: Processes image data for training and classification.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- PyTorch/TensorFlow (depending on the model used)
- OpenCV (for image processing)
- Arduino IDE (for microcontroller programming)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Waste-Classification/waste-classification.git
   cd waste-classification
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the model training:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Open the notebook and execute the training script.
4. Execute the Python script for classification:
   ```bash
   python classify.py
   ```
5. Upload the Arduino code to your microcontroller using the Arduino IDE.

## Usage

- Place an item in front of the camera.
- The system classifies the waste type.
- If connected to an Arduino, the servo motor moves the waste to the correct bin.

## File Structure

- `waste_model.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for training the ML model.
- `classify_waste.py`: Python script for waste classification.
- `Final.ino`: Arduino code to control the servo motor.
- `Data/`: Folder containing training images.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Future Improvements

- Improve model accuracy with a larger dataset.
- Optimize real-time classification speed.
- Implement a user-friendly GUI.
